    <p id="personal"><span>Personal</span><br>I spent the first nineteen years of life in Rockford Illinois where I grew
      up with my
      seven siblings. I enlisted
      in the Air Force shortly after graduating high school. Through the Air Force I gained incredible experiences from
      jumping out of planes thirteen thousand feet in the air to scuba diving one-hundred and fifty feet below the
      surface. I also met my wife the year before I separated the military on a passenger plane(she was my flight
      attendant). After I separated, my wife and I moved to the greater Seattle area which is where I now reside.
