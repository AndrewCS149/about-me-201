    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>I spent the first nineteen years of life in Rockford Illinois where I grew up with my seven siblings. I enlisted
      in the Air Force shortly after graduating high school. Through the Air Force I gained incredible experiences from
      jumping out of planes thirteen thousand feet in the air to scuba diving one-hundred and fifty feet below the
      surface. I also met my wife the year before I separated the military on a passenger plane(she was my flight
      attendant). After I separated, my wife and I moved to the greater Seattle area which is where I now reside.
    </p>

    <h2>Professional</h2>
    <p>Through the military I have grown a wide professional background. I am a certified air traffic controller which
      has taught me to handle stress and task saturation. I have handled various types of communications equipment with
      high levels of encryption. I have organized training events for hundreds of airmen. Most importantly, I have
      learned the value and significance of teamwork.
    </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I have completed classes from Ashford University and North Seattle College. Through those classes I have accrued
      a baseline understanding of Python, JavaScript, MySQL and Java. I have complete Code 102 from Code Fellows and am
      currently self learning c-sharp.
