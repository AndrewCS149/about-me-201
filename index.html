    <h1>Andrew Smith</h1>

  <p id="personal"><span>Personal</span><br>I spent the first nineteen years of life in Rockford Illinois where I grew
    up with my
    seven siblings. I enlisted
    in the Air Force shortly after graduating high school. Through the Air Force I gained incredible experiences from
    jumping out of planes thirteen thousand feet in the air to scuba diving one-hundred and fifty feet below the
    surface. I also met my wife the year before I separated the military on a passenger plane(she was my flight
    attendant). After I separated, my wife and I moved to the greater Seattle area which is where I now reside.
  </p>

  <p id="professional"><span>Professional</span><br>Through the military I have grown a wide professional background.
    I am a certified
    air traffic controller which
    has taught me to handle stress and task saturation. I have handled various types of communications equipment with
    high levels of encryption. I have organized training events for hundreds of airmen. Most importantly, I have
    learned the value and significance of teamwork.
  </p>

  <p id="education"><span>Education</span><br>I have completed classes from Ashford University and North Seattle
    College. Through
    those classes I have accrued
    a baseline understanding of Python, JavaScript, MySQL and Java. I have complete Code 102 from Code Fellows and am
    currently self learning c-sharp.
  </p>

  <p id="goals"><span>Goals</span><br>I have been pursuing software development since July of 2019. Since the, I have
    realized how expansive the
    software developer realm is. My goal is to complete the series of courses at Code Fellows by September and land a
    career with Microsoft. Upon achieving this goal, I will continue to grow my skills by taking on uncomfortable
    challenges and learning new languages annually.</p>
